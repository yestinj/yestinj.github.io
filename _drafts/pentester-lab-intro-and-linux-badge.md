I've been fairly interested in hacking and InfoSec (before I knew the term) for\nas long as I can remember. Over the years I learnt the terms security analyst \nand penetration tester and since then I've been spending my free time learning\nand attempting to gain some practical experience in the field. Performing a\npenetration testing assessment for a client is a vastly different activity to\ndeveloping software for the company you work for, which made this task quite\ndifficult for me, and it's taken me many years to build up the knowledge I have\ntoday.\n\nI recently discovered PentesterLab [http://pentesterlab.com] and decided to take\nthem up on their Black Friday special, after hearing from a good friend how\ngreat their service was. In their own words this service attempts to teach\npeople penetration testing the right way, and provides hands-on exercises to\nenable learning web app security and penetration testing. This site seemed\nperfect as the area of penetration testing is very large, and finding a place\nthat can teach you all there is to know (even just the basics), of every aspect,\nis quite difficult. It's also fairly common for references which do provide such\na foundation to quickly become out of date when not regularly updated, or when\nnot presented in a way that allows for easy updating.
